This class will have the input data for the customers IDs, bar names and the preferences of the customer. It will then use the methods in the ChocolateBar class to print out the results of the calculations.
It will print the Names of the chocolate bars, Names of the customers, preferences of the customer, total preference of each chocolate bar, total preferences that are less than 25,
the most preferred and the least preferred chocolate bar
