This program will take the users input for Fat, Saturates, Sugars , Salt and portion size. 
It will then classify each one of these inputs in terms of Red, Green Amber and Red Per portion.
This classification is done through an IF for each input.

	 Finally if it isn't Red or Amber then it must be green.
	 
	 The result for the classification is then stored in a result string that will be printed to the screen in the User Class
