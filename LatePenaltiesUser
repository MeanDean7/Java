This program will take an input for the mark and an input for the number of days to display. 
It will check if these inputs are between 0 - 100 for the mark and 0-20 for the number of days. If the inputs are outside these ranges then the user will be asked to input them again. 
The program will then use these inputs to calculate both of the schemes.
